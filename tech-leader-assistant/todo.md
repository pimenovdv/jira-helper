## Project Decomposition & Implementation Plan

### Phase 1-7: Foundation, Integrations & Agentic Workflows
- [x] Architecture setup, Clients (GitLab, Jira, Confluence, Neo4j, OpenSearch), RAG Pipeline, Cross-Service features, Agentic RAG tools, Router, and Deep Research Workflow.

### Phase 8: Automation and Assistant Features
- [x] **MR Summarization & Test Generator**: Implement `mr_summarization_task` to iterate open MRs, generate a summary of changes, and suggest test recommendations via LLM, and post the output as a note on the GitLab MR.

## Project Decomposition & Implementation Plan

### Phase 1-10: Completed Items
- [x] Architecture setup, Clients, RAG Pipeline, Agentic Workflows, Code Review, Stale Reminders, etc.

### Phase 11: GitLab MR Automations
- [x] **Automated MR Size Labeler**: Implement `gitlab_mr_size_labeler_task` to calculate diff size of MRs and automatically apply a size label (e.g. `size: S`, `size: L`) to help reviewers prioritize work.

## Project Decomposition & Implementation Plan

### Completed Phases
- [x] Phases 1-80: Initial setup, core sync, DB, RAG workflows, code quality automations, assorted Jira/GitLab/Confluence reminders and checks, various warning tasks for missing attachments, unassigned/stale tasks, missing PR descriptions/approvals, unestimated bugs, missing MR reviewers/too short descriptions, missing components/environment warnings for Jira bugs, confluence page length checks, MR reviewer self-assignment checks, GitLab MR missing milestone warning, Jira Epic Missing Due Date Warning, and Jira Epic Without Child Issues Warning.

### Phase 81: Jira Story Missing Subtasks Warning
- [x] Create `jira_story_missing_subtasks_warning_task` to iterate through open Stories and warn if they have no subtasks.
- [x] Schedule the task to run periodically.
- [x] Add tests to verify the behavior of `jira_story_missing_subtasks_warning_task`.
